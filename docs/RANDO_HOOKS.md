# Randomizer hook log

Every hunk the built-in randomizer adds to `game/` (docs/RANDOMIZER_PLAN.md, "Conventions every step
follows"). A randomizer step appends its own section `## R<phase>.<n>` here, in plan order, in the same
commit as its hunks; on a merge keep both sides.

Rules for a hunk (checked by `python3 -I native/tools/rando_hook_census.py`, which `native/tools/regress.sh`
runs):

- It is on the host side of a `#if TARGET_PC` guard, with the original code in the `#else` where the
  hunk replaces something, and takes the original branch when `pc_rando()` is 0. Guard forms:
  `?:` (`pc_rando() ? new : original`), `||` (`pc_rando() || original`), `if/else`
  (`if (pc_rando()) {new} else {original}`), `add` (new code under `if (pc_rando())` with nothing
  replaced), `include` (`#include "pc/pc_rando.h"`; needs no row).
- The guarded branch holds a marker comment
  `// pc_rando(<step>): <wwrando ref, e.g. flexible_item_locations.asm d_a_bigelf 0x217C>; original: <value>`.
- Each file with a marker of a step has a row in that step's section. One row per function; the
  census matches the first cell (the file path from the repository root, an optional `:line` is
  ignored) and lists stale rows. A step without hunks in `game/` writes a single row whose first cell
  is `-`.
- The event bits wwrando reuses (0x6901-0x6980, 0x6A01-0x6A40; plan D17) appear only in these hunks
  and in the randomizer's own files.

Columns: file, function, guard form, wwrando reference.

## R0.1

| File | Function | Guard | wwrando |
|---|---|---|---|
| - | no hunks in `game/`: the switch (`native/include/pc/pc_rando.h`), the `rando` smoke and the test plumbing | - | - |

## R3.8

| File | Function | Guard | wwrando |
|---|---|---|---|
| game/include/d/actor/d_a_tbox.h | `daTbox_c::getIsTrap` (new inline: param 0x40 while pc_rando(); unused until R6.5) | add | asm/actors/d_a_tbox.cpp `getIsTrap` |
| game/src/d/actor/d_a_tbox.cpp | `commonShapeSet` (open bck; stands for `l_modelInfo[1..3].openBckId` 0x9) | `?:` | asm/actors/d_a_tbox.cpp `l_modelInfo` |
| game/src/d/actor/d_a_tbox.cpp | `getFuncType` (mask 0x3F) | `?:` | asm/actors/d_a_tbox.cpp `getFuncType`/`getIsTrap` |
| game/src/d/actor/d_a_tbox.cpp | `actionOpenWait` (no big chest BGM/lights; event `DEFAULT_TREASURE_A` for every chest) | `if/else`, `\|\|` | asm/actors/d_a_tbox.cpp `actionOpenWait` |
